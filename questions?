questions? 

stops should be a model?..... note[1]:a route has many stops. note[2]; stops needs to be an array

buses?

no join table or many-to-many relation


nested routes policy and roles?


add address to user? ... register address

formtag vs formfor? 
	1) form_for pointing to '/' instead of appropraite route in route's new.html.erb

	@obeject in new is same as @object in create, why create a smae object twice e.g stop new?

	2) form_tag needed paramteres . discuss routes. had to manually give the route instead of url_helper  form_for in new.html.erb for routes
